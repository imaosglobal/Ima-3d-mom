The Eye integration

This repository now contains the integrated core for "The Eye" playable world.

Quick notes:
- Core systems added under `Assets/Core`
- Eye gateway and entry under `Assets/EyeGateway`
- Roles under `Assets/Roles`
- Characters under `Assets/Characters`
- Worlds under `Assets/Worlds`
- Systems (networking, reputation, encounter) under `Assets/Systems`
- UI helpers under `Assets/UI`

Startup: SceneBootstrap will create a runtime `EyeEntry` scene if no `EyeEntry` scene is available in Build Settings. Open the repo in Unity (latest LTS) to inspect, iterate, and run playtests.
